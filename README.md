The aim of this project was to develop a predictive model to forecast the product sales of a specific store. To accomplish this objective, various algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Extra Tree Regressor, were employed and compared using cross-validation score as the metric. The study involved analyzing historical sales data to identify patterns and predict future sales. The comparative study of the different algorithms allowed for an assessment of their effectiveness in forecasting sales, leading to the selection of the most accurate model. The developed model has the potential to provide valuable insights to store managers, allowing them to plan and optimize their inventory, staffing, and pricing strategies more effectively.
